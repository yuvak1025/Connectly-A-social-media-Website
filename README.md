the above project made with tech stack ReactJS , for FrontEnd  we build the structure and layout with tailwind css

npx tailwindcss init

 The main front-end states are managed using Redux Toolkit with different slices for each part of the state. This approach effectively reduces the problem of prop drilling and allows for efficient state management without a complex structure. By organizing the state into slices, each part of the state is managed independently, leading to a more maintainable and scalable application.

npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
